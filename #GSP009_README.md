GSP009 Weather Data in BigQuery
===

**Requirements:**
1. Explore weather data
2. Explore New York citizen complaints data
3. Create a dataset
4. Saving a new table of weather data

## Explore weather data

Navigation menu > BigQuery:

**ADD DATA** > **Explore public datasets**

Search:
`noaa_gsod`


Query:
```sql
SELECT
  -- Create a timestamp from the date components.
  stn,
  TIMESTAMP(CONCAT(year,"-",mo,"-",da)) AS timestamp,
  -- Replace numerical null values with actual null
  AVG(IF (temp=9999.9,
      null,
      temp)) AS temperature,
  AVG(IF (wdsp="999.9",
      null,
      CAST(wdsp AS Float64))) AS wind_speed,
  AVG(IF (prcp=99.99,
      0,
      prcp)) AS precipitation
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod20*`
WHERE
  CAST(YEAR AS INT64) > 2010
  AND CAST(MO AS INT64) = 6
  AND CAST(DA AS INT64) = 12
  AND (stn="725030" OR  -- La Guardia
    stn="744860")    -- JFK
GROUP BY
  stn,
  timestamp
ORDER BY
  timestamp DESC,
  stn ASC
```

## Explore New York citizen complaints data

```sql
SELECT
  EXTRACT(YEAR
  FROM
    created_date) AS year,
  complaint_type,
  COUNT(1) AS num_complaints
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york.311_service_requests`
GROUP BY
  year,
  complaint_type
ORDER BY
  num_complaints DESC
```

## Saving a new table of weather data

**CREATE DATASET**
`demos`

**Check my progress**

```sql
SELECT
  -- Create a timestamp from the date components.
  timestamp(concat(year,"-",mo,"-",da)) as timestamp,
  -- Replace numerical null values with actual nulls
  AVG(IF (temp=9999.9, null, temp)) AS temperature,
  AVG(IF (visib=999.9, null, visib)) AS visibility,
  AVG(IF (wdsp="999.9", null, CAST(wdsp AS Float64))) AS wind_speed,
  AVG(IF (gust=999.9, null, gust)) AS wind_gust,
  AVG(IF (prcp=99.99, null, prcp)) AS precipitation,
  AVG(IF (sndp=999.9, null, sndp)) AS snow_depth
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod20*`
WHERE
  CAST(YEAR AS INT64) > 2008
  AND (stn="725030" OR  -- La Guardia
       stn="744860")    -- JFK
GROUP BY timestamp
