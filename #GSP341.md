# GSP341 Create ML Models with BigQuery ML: Challenge Lab

## Task 1: Create a dataset to store your machine learning models

To create a dataset, highlight your project ID and then select **CREATE DATASET**.

Next, name your Dataset ID `bike` and click **Create dataset**.

## Task 2: Create a forecasting BigQuery machine learning model.

#standardSQL

  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20180101' AND '20181231' ;

## Task 3: Create the second machine learning model.

## Task 4: Evaluate the two machine learning models.

Task 1: Create a dataset to store your machine learning models
bq mk austin



Task 2: Create a forecasting BigQuery machine learning model.
Write the below query in BigQuery  console:
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL

austin.austin_1

OPTIONS(input_label_cols=['duration_minutes'], model_type='linear_reg')

AS SELECT

duration_minutes,

location,

start_station_name,

CAST(EXTRACT(dayofweek FROM start_time) AS STRING) as dayofweek,

CAST(EXTRACT(hour FROM start_time) AS STRING) AS hourofday,

FROM

`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips

JOIN

`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations` AS stations

ON

trips.start_station_id = stations.station_id

WHERE

EXTRACT(year from start_time) = 2018



Then Write the below command in cloud shell :
export PROJECT_ID=DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL austin.austin_1 OPTIONS(input_label_cols=['duration_minutes'], model_type='linear_reg') AS SELECT

duration_minutes, location, start_station_name, CAST(EXTRACT(dayofweek FROM start_time) AS STRING) as dayofweek, CAST(EXTRACT(hour FROM start_time) AS STRING) AS hourofday, FROM \`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips\` AS trips JOIN \`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations\` AS stations ON trips.start_station_id = stations.station_id WHERE EXTRACT(year from start_time) = 2018"



Task 3: Create the second machine learning model.
Write the below query in BigQuery  console:
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL

austin.austin_2

OPTIONS(input_label_cols=['duration_minutes'], model_type='linear_reg')

AS SELECT

duration_minutes,

subscriber_type,

start_station_name,

CAST(EXTRACT(hour FROM start_time) AS STRING) AS hourofday

FROM

`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips

WHERE

EXTRACT(year from start_time) = 2018



Then Write the below command in cloud shell :

export PROJECT_ID=DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL austin.austin_2 OPTIONS(input_label_cols=['duration_minutes'], model_type='linear_reg') AS SELECT duration_minutes, subscriber_type, start_station_name, CAST(EXTRACT(hour FROM start_time) AS STRING) AS hourofday FROM \`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips\` AS trips WHERE EXTRACT(year from start_time) = 2018"



Task 4: Evaluate the two machine learning models.
Write the below query in BigQuery  console:


SELECT

SQRT(mean_squared_error) as rmse, mean_absolute_error

FROM

ML.EVALUATE(MODEL austin.austin_1) ;

SELECT

SQRT(mean_squared_error) as rmse, mean_absolute_error

FROM

ML.EVALUATE(MODEL austin.austin_2);

SELECT

SQRT(mean_squared_error)AS rmse, mean_absolute_error

FROM

ML.EVALUATE (MODEL austin.austin_1, (

SELECT

duration_minutes, location, start_station_name,

CAST(EXTRACT(dayofweek FROM start_time) AS STRING) as dayofweek,

CAST(EXTRACT(hour FROM start_time) AS STRING) AS hourofday,

FROM

`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips

JOIN

`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations` AS stations

ON

trips.start_station_id = stations.station_id

WHERE

EXTRACT(year from start_time) = 2019

));

SELECT

SQRT(mean_squared_error)AS rmse, mean_absolute_error

FROM

ML.EVALUATE(MODEL austin.austin_2, (

SELECT

duration_minutes, subscriber_type, start_station_name,

CAST(EXTRACT(hour FROM start_time) AS STRING) AS hourofday

FROM

`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips

WHERE

EXTRACT(year from start_time) = 2019

))



Then Write the below command in cloud shell :

bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "SELECT SQRT(mean_squared_error)AS rmse, mean_absolute_error FROM ML.EVALUATE(MODEL austin.austin_1, (SELECT duration_minutes, location, start_station_name, CAST(EXTRACT(dayofweek FROM start_time) AS STRING) as dayofweek, CAST(EXTRACT(hour FROM start_time) AS STRING) AS hourofday, FROM \`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips\` AS trips JOIN \`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations\` AS stations ON trips.start_station_id = stations.station_id WHERE EXTRACT(year from start_time) = 2019))"

bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "SELECT SQRT(mean_squared_error)AS rmse, mean_absolute_error FROM ML.EVALUATE(MODEL austin.austin_2, (SELECT duration_minutes, subscriber_type, start_station_name, CAST(EXTRACT(hour FROM start_time) AS STRING) AS hourofday FROM \`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips\` AS trips WHERE EXTRACT(year from start_time) = 2019))"





Task 5: Use the subscriber type machine learning model to predict average trip durations
Write the below query in BigQuery  console:


SELECT start_station_name, avg(duration_minutes) as avg_duration, count(*) as total_trips

FROM

`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`



WHERE

EXTRACT(year FROM start_time) = 2019

GROUP BY start_station_name

ORDER BY total_trips DESC



Then Write the below command in cloud shell :

bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "SELECT start_station_name, avg(duration_minutes) as avg_duration, count(*) as total_trips FROM \`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips\` WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM start_time) = 2019 GROUP BY start_station_name ORDER BY total_trips DESC"



Now again in BigQuery Editor write this command :

SELECT

avg(predicted_duration_minutes),count(duration_minutes)

FROM

Ml.PREDICT(MODEL austin.austin_2, (

SELECT

duration_minutes,

subscriber_type,

start_station_name,

CAST(EXTRACT(hour FROM start_time) AS STRING) AS hourofday

FROM

`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` AS trips

WHERE

EXTRACT(year from start_time) = 2019

and start_station_name = '21st & Speedway @PCL'

and subscriber_type='Single Trip'

))



Now again in Cloud SHell write this command :
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "SELECT avg(predicted_duration_minutes),count(duration_minutes) FROM Ml.PREDICT(MODEL austin.austin_2, (SELECT duration_minutes, subscriber_type, start_station_name, CAST(EXTRACT(hour FROM start_time) AS STRING) AS hourofday FROM \`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips\` AS trips WHERE EXTRACT(year from start_time)=2019 and start_station_name = '21st & Speedway @PCL' and subscriber_type='Single Trip' ))"
